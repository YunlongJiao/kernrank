# kernrank

`kernrank` is an `R` package implementing kernel functions and kernel methods for analyzing rank data, typically total rankings (namely permutations), interleaving and top-k partial rankings, multivariate rankings. This package is built upon the [CRAN package `RMallow`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMallow/index.html) and serves as a stable update and mostly a significant extension of that package.
